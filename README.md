## Details

### Ordered and Unordered Lists

We learned different ways to create ordered and unordered lists in HTML. During this learning process, we utilized the `<ul>` tag for unordered lists and the `<ol>` tag for ordered lists.

### Paragraph Tags

To display text in paragraphs, we used the `<p>` tag. This tag helps in grouping text in an organized and readable manner.

### Heading Tags

In HTML, headings are used to specify the hierarchical structure of the text. Heading tags from H1 to H6 are used to indicate the importance of the text.

This repository reflects my progress in learning HTML 5. I plan to add more topics and examples in the future.
